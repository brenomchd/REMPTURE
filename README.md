**Rempture** is a 2D psychological horror platformer auto-runner, where light and shadow are not just visual effects—they are your only hope for survival. You control a boy trapped in a recurring nightmare, trying to escape a haunted mansion before the darkness—and a terrifying entity known as the **Stalker** catches you.
